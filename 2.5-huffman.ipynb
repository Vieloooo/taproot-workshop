In our implementation, we first sort our queue by **assigned frequency**, then by **tagged hash** value. This way, the sorting of the queue is always unambiguous given a distinct set of leaves. _This secondary, arbitrary sorting criteria does not affect the expected witness weight of spending along the script path, since the assigned frequencies of the leaves or tapbranches in question are equal._"
